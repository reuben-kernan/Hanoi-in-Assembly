# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Summary

The flagship of this project is the implementation of the Towers of
Hanoi algorithm using Assembly. Supplementary challenges include
building an implementation of a stack, as well as building an
implementation of a queue. These challenges were originally assigned as
bonus problems during the ’Data Structures & Algorithms’ course, where
implementation was done in C++. This is not a direct port of the
original implementation, rather, implementation is performed from the
ground up. The challenge is completed using MASM32.

## 1.2 Goals

  - Implement a stack data structure

  - Implement a queue data structure

  - Solve the Towers of Hanoi problem
  
  ## 1.3 Towers of Hanoi Concepts \[1\]

Rules:

1.  Only one disk can be moved at a time.

2.  Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks
    and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved
    if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.

3.  No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

## 1.4 Challenges

1.  The complexity of Towers of Hanoi scales exponentially with the
    number of disks to be transferred. The minimum moves required is:
    ’\(2^{n}-1\)’ where ’\(n\)’ is the number of disks. If the solver
    could perform 1,000 moves per second, and there were 100 disks, then
    it would take approximately \(4.0\times10^{19}\) years to solve.
    Clearly, performance is of utmost importance when attempting to
    solve Towers of Hanoi with an increasing number of disks. For this
    reason, registers are used often as possible in the implementation
    due to their speed of execution compared to variables which will be
    physically further in memory storage.

2.  Preserving values saved within registers presents a significant
    problem, particularly when using recursion, or procedures that
    invoke other procedures. For example, changing the ECX register
    inside the \_stackPush function could affect the initialize\_loop in
    \_main. Due to challenge 1, no effort is made to save off registers
    before invoking procedures in an attempt to increase efficiency.
    Therefore, all code is very mindful of which registers are used or
    can be overwritten.

3.  Output is foregone entirely within this program, making it difficult
    to assess functionality. The program is tested manually on a small
    scale, where \_maxHeight is initialized to 10, and \_diskNum to 3.
    Testing is described in section 3.

4.  OURSTACK and OURQUEUE are not intrinsically linked to their
    respective procedures. This means that their contents are bared to
    the entire program, allowing it to access elements in a way not
    intended. Two implementations of a queue are demonstrated, one
    operating directly on OURSTACK to mimic the behavior of a queue, and
    the other using its own separate procedures and STRUCT definition.
    More on this topic in section 2.2.

# 2 Implementation

## 2.1 Stack

    _stackPush PROTO C, Stack:DWORD, value:BYTE
    _stackPop  PROTO C, Stack:DWORD
    .DATA
    OURSTACK STRUCT
        height    BYTE 0
        levels    BYTE _maxHeight DUP(0)
    OURSTACK ENDS

OURSTACK is declared within the .DATA segment. This enables any number
of instances to be created in the code, where all values are initialized
to 0. For the niche purpose of solving the Towers of Hanoi, each data
point used occupies only a single byte. The maximum value for the height
of a stack is 255 elements, allowing representation of more than enough
disks in Towers of Hanoi to occupy Multivac \[1\]. The \_maxHeight
global variable is used as a single access point to infinitely scale the
number of elements that can be stored in OURSTACK, though technically
height could overflow if more than 255 elements are pushed.

There are two companion procedures to OURSTACK. \_stackPush is used with
INVOKE to pass in a pointer to an instance of OURSTACK and a value to be
pushed onto it. It attempts to push, but returns -1 in the AL register
if the stack is full. \_stackPop is used with INVOKE to pass in only a
pointer, and returns -1 if the stack is empty.

This stack provides the bones for representing the three towers used in
Towers of Hanoi: Source, Auxiliary, and Destination. OURSTACK was
designed specifically as a companion to the Towers of Hanoi problem,
thus informing the design process. Maximum number of disks is limited to
255 out of practicality, any more would take too much computing power.
Disks are initialized sequentially starting from \_maxHeight (biggest)
to 1 (smallest), therefore levels only holds byte-size elements since
the largest a disk can be is 255.

## 2.2 Queue

### 2.2.1 Fake Queue

    _stackDequeue PROTO C, Stack:DWORD

The \_stackDequeue procedure is implemented to give a queue-like feature
to the OURSTACK struct. This function removes the element that is at the
bottom of the stack, returns it, and then shifts every element down so
that the stackl can fill in the missing hole. This demonstrates the
unprotected nature of the STRUCT implementation.

### 2.2.2 Real Queue

    _enqueue PROTO C, Queue:DWORD, value:BYTE
    _dequeue PROTO C, Queue:DWORD
    .DATA
    OURQUEUE STRUCT
        Input  OURSTACK <>
        Output OURSTACK <>
    OURQUEUE ENDS

OURQUEUE is declared in the .DATA segment. Like OURSTACK, any number of
instances can be created, and all values are initialized to 0. This
queue implementation uses two stacks to represent the queue. As it is
built on the OURSTACK implementation, it is subject to the same
limitations. The Input stack initially holds any element that is
enqueued, or pushed onto it. When a dequeue is requested, and if the
Output stack is empty, then a loop pops all elements from Input and
pushes them onto Output, reversing their order in the stack, after which
one element is popped from Output. For consistency with OURSTACK, the
number of elements in the queue is artificially limited to \_maxHeight,
even though it could contain twice as many elements as OURSTACK.

There are two companion procedures to OURQUEUE. \_enqueue is used with
INVOKE to pass in a pointer to an instance of OURQUEUE and a value to be
pushed onto it. It manipulates the two stacks as described above, and
through he AL register it returns either the first value that was placed
into the queue, or -1 to indicate the queue is empty. It is \_enqueue’s
responsibility to enforce the artificial size limit. \_dequeue is used
with INVOKE to pass in only a pointer, and returns -1 if the queue is
empty. \_dequeue is more computationally heavy than \_enqueue, as it is
responsible for moving every element from Input to Output.

OURQUEUE is not relevant in the implementation of Towers of Hanoi, it is
simply here as a bonus solution.

## 2.3 Towers of Hanoi

    _towers PROTO C, disks:BYTE, Source:DWORD, 
                     Destination:DWORD, Auxiliary:DWORD

\_towers is the implementation of the Towers of Hanoi algorithm. Despite
the computational complexity of the problem, the solution in contrast is
quite simple and elegant. This procedure is merely 25 lines long,
including comments and whitespace. \_towers is used with INVOKE to pass
in the number of disks, and three pointers to instances of OURSTACK,
being Source, Auxiliary, and Destination. Note that the order in which
towers are passed into \_towers changes throughout the recursive calls
\[lines 461-463\], therefore the original towers can act in different
roles. If disks is 1, then it skips to swap, making no more recursive
calls, else three calls to \_towers are made, passing towers in
different orders each time.

# 3 Testing

## 3.1 General

\_main is the test stub for this project. It is here where simulations
run to test the procedures for the OURSTACK and OURQUEUE structs as well
as the Towers of Hanoi problem. Four tests are run, one for general
OURSTACK operations, one for general OURQUEUE operations, one for the
\_stackDequeue procedure, and one to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem.
If a test encounters an invalid value, such as the disks on the
destination tower in the Towers of Hanoi test being in the wrong order,
the process will exit with a non-zero code indicating which test failed.
This however does not allow to see if multiple tests failed, but works
well enough.

## 3.2 Towers of Hanoi Speed

In addition to testing all the functional aspects, tests are run to see
how a computer\[1\] could complete the Towers of Hanoi problem with
varying levels of complexity. To time the process Visual Studio’s built
in diagnostics tool is used which can give the amount of time used
between breakpoints while debugging.

The first trial is run with only twenty disks, this is small enough to
be done quickly and get a feel for how fast it can be executed. This
trial takes only thirty-two milliseconds, and later trials a bumped up
to the thirties for further trials. Thirty disks takes about thirteen
seconds to complete, with thirty-five taking nearly seven minutes to
solve.
